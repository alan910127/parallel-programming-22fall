# Homework 2: Multi-thread Programming

## Part 1: Parallel Counting PI using Pthreads

- [x] Correctness: Accurate to three decimal places with at least `1e8` tosses
- [x] Scalability: Tested with 2, 3, 4 or more threads, should run faster
- [x] Performance: Run `time (./pi.out 3 100000000; ./pi.out 4 100000000)`
  - [x] Maximum Time Limit `T=1s`
  - [x] Competitiveness `T=0.5s`

## Part 2: Parallel Fractal Generation using `std::thread`

- [x] Correctness
- [x] Performance: Run `./mandelbrot -t 3` and `./mandelbrot -t 4` (consider only the time of `[mandel thread]`)
  - [x] Maximum Time Limit `T=0.375s`
  - [x] Competitiveness `T=0.28s`
